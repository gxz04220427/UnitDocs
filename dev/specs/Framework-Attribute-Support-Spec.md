> **NOTE:** This page is a specification that was used as a starting point for creating the feature in NUnit. It needs to be reviewed and revised in order to accurately reflect what was actually built. If you take it with a grain of salt, it may still be helpful to you as documentation. This notice will be removed when the page is brought up to date.

This page lists all attributes to be supported by the NUnit 3.0 framework. Not all attributes are supported equally by the various framework distributions. See [[Attribute Support|Framework-Distributions#attribute-support]] for details of where each attribute is supported.

### Existing (2.6.3) Attributes
