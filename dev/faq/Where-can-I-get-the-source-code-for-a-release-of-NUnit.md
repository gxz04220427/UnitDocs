The source code for each release of NUnit is available as a [[download|http://nunit.org/?p=download]], with a name like "NUnit-2.6.2-src.zip." You would normally not want to use a release version of the source when working on bug fixes or features for NUnit, since that source becomes out of date very quickly.
		 
However, you may want to use a release version of the source...

  * To create a debug version of a particular release and step through it.
  * To make your own local changes to NUnit
  * To learn how NUnit works
