NUnit development is currently hosted on [[Launchpad|http://launchpad.net/nunit-xtp]] but
we are in the process of moving it to [[GitHub|https://github.com/nunit/]].

GithHub provides an environment that encourages individuals to work on
open source projects with a very low entry barrier. No special permission
is needed to fork any repository and all your changes can be pushed to your fork on GitHub.
GitHub also makes it easy to merge your changes into the main project using Pull Requests.

Since we are anxious to have increased community involvement in NUnit
development, GitHub seems to be an ideal host for us.  See
[[Migration to Github]] for the current status of this ongoing change.

**Note:** *Versions through 2.5.2 were maintained on [[Sourceforge|http://sourceforge.net/projects/nunit]],
where you can still find the code for older releases.*
