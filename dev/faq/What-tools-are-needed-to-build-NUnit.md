####What tools are needed to build nunit?

To work on NUnit you need
  * C#, try [[Visual Studio Express|http://www.microsoft.com/express/]], [[SharpDevelop|http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/]] or [[MonoDevelop|http://monodevelop.com]]
  * [[NAnt|http://nant.sourceforge.net/]] - a C# "makefile" like build tool
  * [[WiX|http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/]] - an installer generator
  * [[Git Client|http://git-scm.com/downloads]] - a distributed source control system
  * [[Git Client Gui|http://www.sourcetreeapp.com]] - This Git client contains a Gui and is optional

One easy place to start is downloading a source-snapshot from the [[downloads page|http://nunit.org/index.php?p=download]]. Once you have NAnt installed and a C# dev environment installed, you should be able to run NAnt.exe in the root directory of the project to build the sources. 

If you'd like to get the latest sources, you'll need to install [[Git|https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git]] and [[join GitHub|https://github.com/signup/free]]. The sources are located on GitHub at

  * [[https://github.com/nunit/nunitv2]] for NUnit 2.6
  * [[https://github.com/nunit/nunit]] for NUnit 3.0
  * [[https://github.com/nunit/nunitlite]]

You should join the developers mailing list as well, at [[http://groups.google.com/group/nunit-developer]].
