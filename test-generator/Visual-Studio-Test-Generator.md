This is an extension for Visual Studio 2015 that extends
the test functionality to allow you to create unit tests and IntelliTests.
This extension extends the built in test generator functionality allowing
developers to generate tests using NUnit 2.6.x or NUnit 3.0.

Please note that IntelliTest is only available in Visual
