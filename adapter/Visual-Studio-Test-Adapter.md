The NUnit 3.0 Test Adapter allows you to run NUnit 3.0 tests inside Visual Studio. This is a new adapter, based partly on the code of the original NUnit Test Adapter, but modified to work with NUnit 3.0.

It is not possible to run NUnit 2.x tests using this adapter. Use the original adapter for that purpose. If you need to work with projects using NUnit 2.x and other projects using NUnit 3.0, you may install both versions of the adapter.

The current 3.0 Beta release is designed to work with Visual Studio 2012, 2013 and 2015. Some features are not available under VS2012 RTM.

Releases of Visual Studio prior to VS 2012 did not have the ability to directly run tests built with Open Source testing frameworks like NUnit.
