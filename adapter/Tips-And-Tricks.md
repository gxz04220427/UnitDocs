###Registry Settings

Certain settings in the registry affect how the adapter runs. All these settings are added by using RegEdit under the key **HKCU\Software\nunit.org\VSAdapter**.

####ShadowCopy

By default NUnit no longer uses shadowcopy. If this causes an issue for you shadowcopy can be enabled by setting the DWORD value UseShadowCopy to 1.   
  
####KeepEngineRunning

By default the NUnit adapter will "Kill" the Visual Studio Test Execution engine after each run. Visual Studio 2013 and later has a new setting under its top menu, **Test | Test Settings | Keep Test Execution Engine Running**. The adapter normally ignores this setting.

In some cases it can be useful to have the engine running, e.g. during debugging of the adapter itself. You can then set the adapter to follow the VS setting by setting the DWORD value UseVsKeepEngineRunning to 1.

####Verbosity

Normally the adapter reports exceptions using a short format, consisting of the message only. You can change it to report a verbose format that includes the stack trace, by setting a the DWORD value Verbosity to 1.
