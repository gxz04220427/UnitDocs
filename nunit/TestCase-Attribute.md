**TestCaseAttribute** serves the dual purpose of marking a method with
parameters as a test method and providing inline data to be used when
invoking that method. Here is an example of a test being run three
times, with three different sets of data:
   
```C#
[TestCase(12,3,4)]
[TestCase(12,2,6)]
[TestCase(12,4,3)]
public void DivideTest(int n, int d, int q)
{
  Assert.AreEqual( q, n / d );
}
```

**Note:** Because arguments to .NET attributes are limited in terms of the 
Types that may be used, NUnit will make some attempt to convert the supplied
values using `Convert.ChangeType()` before supplying it to the test.

**TestCaseAttribute** may appear one or more times on a test method,
which may also carry other attributes providing test data.
The method may optionally be marked with the [[Test Attribute]] as well.

By using the named parameter `ExpectedResult` this test set may be simplified
further:

```C#
[TestCase(12,3, ExpectedResult=4)]
[TestCase(12,2, ExpectedResult=6)]
[TestCase(12,4, ExpectedResult=3)]
public int DivideTest(int n, int d)
{
  return( n / d );
}
```

In the above example, NUnit checks that the return
value of the method is equal to the expected result provided on the attribute.

TestCaseAttribute supports a number of additional named parameters:

 * **Author** sets the author of the test.

 * **Category** provides a comma-delimited list of categories for this test.

 * **Description** sets the description property of the test.

 * **ExcludePlatform** specifies a comma-deliminted list of platforms on which the test should not run.

 * **ExpectedResult** sets the expected result to be returned from the method, which must have a compatible return type.

 * **Explicit** is set to true in order to make the individual test case Explicit. Use **Reason** to explain why.

 * **Ignore*** causes the test case to be ignored and specifies the reason.

 * **IgnoreReason** causes this test case to be ignored and specifies the reason.

 * **IncludePlatform** specifies a comma-delimited list of platforms on which the test should run.

 * **Reason** specifies the reason for not running this test case. Use in conjunction with <b>Explicit</b>.

 * **TestName** provides a name for the test. If not specified, a name is generated based on the method name and the arguments provided.

 * **TestOf** specifies the Type that this test is testing

####Order of Execution

Individual test cases are executed in the order in which NUnit discovers them.
This order does **not** necessarily follow the lexical order of the attributes
and will often vary between different compilers or different versions of the CLR.
   
As a result, when <b>TestCaseAttribute</b> appears multiple times on a method
or when other data-providing attributes are used in combination with 
<b>TestCaseAttribute</b>, the order of the test cases is undefined.
