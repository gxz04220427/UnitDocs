<p>This attribute is to identify methods that are called once prior to executing any of the tests
	in a fixture. It may appear on methods of a TestFixture or a SetUpFixture.
	
<p>OneTimeSetUp methods may be either static or
   instance methods and you may define more than one of them in a fixture.
   Normally, multiple OneTimeSetUp methods are only defined at different levels
   of an inheritance hierarchy, as explained below.

<p>If a OneTimeSetUp method fails or throws an exception, none of the tests
   in the fixure are executed and a failure or error is reported.

<h4>Example:</h4>

```C#
namespace NUnit.Tests
{
  using System;
  using NUnit.Framework;

  [TestFixture]
  public class SuccessTests
  {
    [OneTimeSetUp]
    public void Init()
    { /* ... */ }

    [OneTimeTearDown]
    public void Cleanup()
    { /* ... */ }

    [Test]
    public void Add()
    { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>The OneTimeSetUp attribute is inherited from any base class. Therefore, if a base 
	class has defined a OneTimeSetUp method, that method will be called 
	before any methods in the derived class. 
	
<p>You may define a OneTimeSetUp method
   in the base class and another in the derived class. NUnit will call base
   class OneTimeSetUp methods before those in the derived classes.
   
<h4>Notes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Although it is possible to define multiple OneTimeSetUp methods
   in the same class, you should rarely do so. Unlike methods defined in
   separate classes in the inheritance hierarchy, the order in which they
   are executed is not guaranteed.
<li>OneTimeSetUp methods may be async if running under .NET 4.0 or higher.
</ol>
