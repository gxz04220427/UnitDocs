<p>The nunit-agent.exe program is used by other runners when the tests are being
   run in a separate process. It is not intended for direct execution by users.

<p>NUnit runs tests in a separate process by default.

<p>When running under the Gui, NUnit will continue to use the same 
   process to reload tests so that it is not normally necessary to 
   re-attach to a new process. However, if the settings are changed
   in a way that requires a different process - for example, by changing 
   the version of the runtime that is being used - the old process will
   be terminated and a new one created. In that case, it's necessary
   to re-attach to the new process.

<h4>Debugging</h4>

<p>When debugging tests that are run in a separate process, it is 
   not possible to do so by simply running the console or gui runner
   under the debugger. Rather, it is necessary to attach the debugger
   to the nunit-agent process after the tests have been loaded.
