<p>The **Author** Attribute adds information about the author of the tests. It can be applied to test fixtures and to tests.

<p>The constructor takes the name of the test author and optionally the author's email address. Author can also be specified on
a TestFixture or Test attribute.

```C#
[TestFixture]
[Author("Jane Doe", "jane.doe@example.com")]
public class MyTests
{
 [Test]
 public void Test1() { /* ... */ }

 [Test]
 [Author("Joe Developer")]
 public void Test2() { /* ... */ }
}

[TestFixture(Author = "Jane Doe")]
public class MyOtherTests
{
 [Test]
 public void Test1() { /* ... */ }

 [Test(Author = "Joe Developer")]
 public void Test2() { /* ... */ }
}
```

<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can currently only have one Author attribute per fixture or test.
