###UNDER CONSTRUCTION

NUnit 3.0 is based on NUnit version 2, but with substantial redesign and a new codebase. This page summarizes what's different between NUnit 2.6.4, the last version 2 release, and NUnit 3.0.

##General Changes

  * The previous NUnitLite framework, released as version 1.0, is now merged with the NUnit framework.

  * The license for NUnit is now MIT / X11.

##Framework

###Platforms

 * The NUnit framework is now built for a number of different platforms:
   * .NET 4.5 (also used for runtimes greater than 4.5)
   * .Net 4.0
   * .NET 2.0
   * Portable Class Library supporting 
     * .NET 4.5+
     * .NET Core (Universal Windows Apps 10+, DNX Core 5+)
     * Windows 8
     * Windows Phone 8 (Silverlight)
     * Universal (Windows Phone 8.1+, Windows 8.1+), 
     * Xamarin (MonoTouch, MonoAndroid, Xamarin iOS Universal)
   * Silverlight 5.0
   * .NET Compact Framework 3.5

 * The Silverlight and Compact Framework builds are separate downloads for those who need them.

 * Users targeting .NET 4.0 who want to write async tests will need
   to reference the Microsoft.Bcl.Async NuGet package.

###Attributes

 * The following new attributes have been added:
   * **TestFixtureSourceAttribute** is equivalent to TestCaseSource for fixtures.
   * **RetryAttribute** allows retrying of failing tests.
   * **LevelOfParallelismAttribute** and **ParallelizableAttribute** support test execution in parallel.
   * **ApartmentAttribute** is used to specify the apartment in which a test should be run.

 * The following attributes have been modified:
   * `TestCaseAttribute` and `TestCaseData` now allow modifying the test name without replacing it entirely.
   * The RangeAttribute has been extended to support more data types including uint, long and ulong
   * The named members of the TestCaseSource and ValueSource attributes must now be static.
   * RandomAttribute has been extended to add support for new data types including uint, long, ulong, short, ushort, float, byte and sbyte
   * TestCaseAttribute now allows arguments with default values to be omitted. Additionaly, it accepts IncludePlatform and ExcludePlatform properties to specify the platforms on which the test case should be run.
   * TestFixture and TestCase attributes now enforce the requirement that a reason needs to be provided when ignoring a test.
   * SetUp, TearDown, OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown methods may now be async.
   * Multiple SetUpFixtures may be specified in a single namespace.
   * ActionAttributes now allow specification of multiple targets on the attribute as designed. This didn't work in the first alpha.
   * Action Attributes have been added with the same features as in NUnit 2.6.3.

 * Parameterized test cases now support nullable arguments.
 * Tests skipped due to ExplicitAttribute are now reported as skipped.
 * Significant improvements have been made in how NUnit deduces the type arguments of 
   generic methods based on the arguments provided.
 * The ExpectedExceptionAttribute is no longer supported. Use Assert.Throws() or Assert.That(..., Throws) instead for a more precise specification of where the exception is expected to be thrown.
 * ExpectedResult is now supported on simple (non-TestCase) tests.
 * The Ignore attribute now takes a named parameter Until, which allows specifying a date after which the test is no longer ignored.
 * The following new values are now recognized by PlatformAttribute: Win7, Win8, Win8.1, Win2012Server, Win2012ServerR2, NT6.1, NT6.2, 32-bit, 64-bit
 * ValuesAttribute may be used without any values on an enum or boolean argument. All possible values are used.

###Asserts
 * Unnecessary overloads of Assert.That and Assume.That have been removed.
 * Assert.NullOrEmpty is no longer supported (Use Is.Null.Or.Empty)
 * FileAssert.Exists and FileAssert.DoesNotExist

###Constraints
 * New SupersetConstraint and Is.SupersetOf syntax complement SubsetConstraint.
 * Added Throws.ArgumentNullException
 * When checking the equality of DateTimeOffset, you can now use the 
   WithSameOffset modifier
 * A new Constraint, <b>DictionaryContainsKeyConstraint</b>, may be used to test that a specified key is present in a dictionary.
 * Does prefix operator supplies several added constraints.
 * A new FileExistsConstraint has been added.
 * You may now specify a tolerance using Within when testing equality of DateTimeOffset values.

###Other
 * TestContext.Random has also been extended to add support for new data types including 
   uint, long, ulong, short, ushort, float, byte, sbyte and decimal
 * Added GetString methods to NUnit.Framework.Internal.RandomGenerator to 
   create repeatable random strings for testing
 * Some classes intended for internal usage that were public for testing
   have now been made internal. Additional classes will be made internal
   for the final 3.0 release.
 * The class and method names of each test are included in the output xml where applicable.
 * String arguments used in test case names are now truncated to 40 rather than 20 characters.
 * String arguments over 20 characters in length are truncated when used as part of a test name.
 * The Pairwise strategy test case generation algorithm has been improved.
 * All addin support has been removed from the framework. Documentation of NUnit 3.0 extensibility features will be published in time for the beta release. In the interim, please ask for support on the nunit-discuss list.
 * Legacy suites are no longer supported
 * TestContext now has a method that allows writing to the XML output.
 * TestContext.CurrentContext.Result now provides the error message and stack trace during teardown.
 * NUnit no longer supports void async test methods. You should use a Task return Type instead.
 * Parallel test execution is supported down to the Fixture level. Use ParallelizableAttribute to indicate types that may be run in parallel.
 * Async tests are supported for .NET 4.0 if the user has installed support for them.
 * The XML output now includes a start and end time for each test.
 * TestContext is now supported and includes an additional property, <b>Random</b>, which may be used to generate repeatable random values for use in a test.
 * The external framework API is now stable; internal interfaces are separate from API
 * Tests may be run in parallel on separate threads
 * Created new API for controlling framework
 * Support for old style tests has been removed

##NUnitLite

 * The NUnitLite report output has been standardized to match that of nunit-console.
 * The NUnitLite command-line has been standardized to match that of nunit-console where they share the same options.
 * The NUnitLite runner now produces the same output display and XML results as the console runner.
 * NUnitLite tests must reference both the nunit.framework and nunitlite assemblies.
 * NUnitLite code is now merged with NUnit
 * Added NUnitLite runner to the framework code
 * The Silverlight runner now displays output in color and includes any text output created by the tests.
 * The NUnit and NUnitLite frameworks have now been merged. There is no longer any distinction
   between them in terms of features, although some features are not available on all platforms.

##Engine

 * The format of the XML result file has been finalized and documented.
 * The engine now runs multiple test assemblies in parallel by default
 * The output XML now includes more information about the test run, including the text of the command used, any engine settings and the filter used to select tests.
 * Extensions may now specify data in an identifying attribute, for use by the engine in deciding whether to load that extension.
 * We now use Cecil to examine assemblies prior to loading them.
 * Extensions are no longer based on Mono.Addins but use our own extension framework.
 * If the target framework is not specified, test assemblies that are compiled
   to target .NET 4.5 will no longer run in .NET 4.0 compatibility mode  
 * The engine API has now been finalized. It permits specifying a minimum version of the engine that a runner is able to use. The best installed version of the engine will be loaded. Third-party runners may override the selection process by including a copy of the engine in their installation directory and specifying that it must be used.
 * The V2 framework driver now uses the event listener and test listener passed to it by the runner. This corrects several outstanding issues  caused by events not being received and allows selecting V2 tests to  be run from the command-line, in the same way that V3 tests are selected.
 * The engine is now extensible using Mono.Addins. In this release, extension points are provided for FrameworkDrivers, ProjectLoaders and OutputWriters. The following addins are bundled as a part of NUnit:
   * A FrameworkDriver that allows running NUnit V2 tests under NUnit 3.0.
   * ProjectLoaders for NUnit and Visual Studio projects.
   * An OutputWriter that creates XML output in NUnit V2 format.
 * DomainUsage now defaults to Multiple if not specified by the runner
 * A driver is now included, which allows running NUnit 2.x tests under NUnit 3.0.
 * The engine can now load and run tests specified in a number of project formats:
   * NUnit (.nunit)
   * Visual Studio C# projects (.csproj)
   * Visual Studio F# projects (.vjsproj)
   * Visual Studio Visual Basic projects (.vbproj)
   * Visual Studio solutions (.sln)
   * Legacy C++ and Visual JScript projects (.csproj and .vjsproj) are also supported
   * Support for the current C++ format (.csxproj) is not yet available
 * Creation of output files like TestResult.xml in various formats is now a
   service of the engine, available to any runner.
 * The logic of runtime selection has now changed so that each assembly runs by default
   in a separate process using the runtime for which it was built.
 * On 64-bit systems, each test process is automatically created as 32-bit or 64-bit,
   depending on the platform specified for the test assembly. 

##Console Runner

   **NOTE:** The `nunit3-console` runner cannot run tests that reference the portable build. 
   You may run such tests using NUnitLite or a platform-specific runner.
 * The console runner program is now called `nunit3-console`.
 * Console runner output has been modified so that the summary comes at the end, to reduce the need for scrolling.
 * The console now displays all settings used by the engine to run tests as well as the filter used to select tests.
 * The console runner accepts a new option --maxagents. If multiple assemblies are run in separate processes, this value may be used to limit the number that are executed simultaneously in parallel.
 * The console runner no longer accepts the --include and --exclude options. Instead, the new --where option provides a more general way to express which tests will be executed, such as --where "cat==Fast && Priority==High". See the docs for details of the syntax.
 * The new --debug option causes NUnit to break in the debugger immediately before tests are run. This simplifies debugging, especially when the test is run in a separate process.
 * OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown failures are now shown on the test report. Individual test failures after OneTimeSetUp failure are no longer shown.
 * If the console is run without arguments, it will now display help
 * The console now defaults to not using shadowcopy. There is a new option **--shadowcopy** to turn it on if needed.
 * New options supported:
   * --testlist provides a list of tests to run in a file
   * --stoponerror indicates that the run should terminate when any test fails.
 * The command-line may now include any number of assemblies and/or supported projects.
 * The console runner now runs tests in a separate process per assembly by default. They may
   still be run in process or in a single separate process by use of command-line options.
 * The console runner now starts in the highest version of the .NET runtime available, making
   it simpler to debug tests by specifying that they should run in-process on the command-line.
 * The -x86 command-line option is provided to force execution in a 32-bit process on a 64-bit system.
 * A writeability check is performed for each output result file before trying to run the tests.
 * The -teamcity option is now supported.
 * The console runner no longer displays test results in the debugger.
 * The console runner now automatically detects 32- versus 64-bit test assemblies.
 * Both nunit-console and NUnitLite now display output in color.
 * The console runner refuses to run tests build with older versions of NUnit. A plugin will be available to run older tests in the future.
