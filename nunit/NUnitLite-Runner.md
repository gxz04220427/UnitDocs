NUnitLite started out life as a separate version of the NUnit framework, with fewer features 
and a built-in test runner. It ran on devices as well as on desktop .NET and mono and allowed 
users to create executable tests without the overhead of a full NUnit installation.

With NUnit 3.0, the NUnitLite framework has been merged with the full NUnit framework. There
is now only one framework, <b>nunit.framework.dll</b>. The built-in runner, 
which was a part of the old NUnitLite, is now packaged as <b>nunitlite.dll</b>.

<h4>Using NUnitLite</h4>

To run tests under NUnitLite, proceed as follows:

1. Create a console application to use as your test assembly. If you have already placed tests in a dll, you can change the project so that it produces a console application and reload it.

2. Make sure your test assembly references both <b>nunit.framework</b> and <b>nunitlite</b>.

3. The Main() for your console application should look something like this...
   ```C#
    public static int Main(string[] args)
    {
      return new AutoRun().Execute(args);
    }
   ```

4. Execute your test application in order to run the tests.

If you install the NUnitLite runner via the NuGet package, steps 2 is handled
automatically. Both assemblies are installed and referenced for you.

In addition, if you are using C#, step 3 is handled as well. A file, Program.cs, 
is added to your project with a Main() like that above. 

**Note:** If you are not working in C#, you should delete the Program.cs file
that the NuGet package added to your test project.

<h4>NUnitLite Output</h4>

As seen in the following screen shot, the output from an NUnitLite run is quite similar to that from the console runner.
